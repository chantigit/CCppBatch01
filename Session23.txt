file3.c: Write a c program to write your name,age & height into "biodata2.txt" file.
=======
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	FILE  *fp;
	
	int age=14;
	float height=5.7;
	char name[10]="Haresh";
	
	fp=fopen("biodata2.txt","w");
	
	fprintf(fp,"%d,%f,%s",age,height,name);
	
	fclose(fp);
	
	printf("Write operation is done");
}



file4.c: Write a c program to append your city to "biodata2.txt" file.
=======

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
	FILE  *fp;
	

	char city[10]="Hyd";
	
	fp=fopen("biodata2.txt","a");
	
	fprintf(fp,"%s",city);
	
	fclose(fp);
	
	printf("Append operation is done");
}

file5.c: Write a c program to read data from "biodata2.txt" file.
=======
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
   char ch;
   FILE *fp;

   fp = fopen("biodata2.txt", "r"); 
 
  	while((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
	{
		printf("%c", ch);	
	}
   fclose(fp);
}
===============================================

1.Pointers we used in functions  (Call By Value & Call by Address)
2.Pointers we used in string
3.Pointers we used in structures & unions

4.Pointers we used in files

5.Pointers we used in arrays (Memory Leakage Issue)

#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    int a[4]={1,2,3,4};
    int *p1;
    p1=a;
    printf("%d \n",a[0]);
    printf("%d \n",a[1]);
    printf("%d \n",a[2]);
    printf("%d \n",a[3]);
    printf("%p \n",a);      //Address of first element
    printf("%p \n",&a[0]);  //Address of first element
    printf("%p \n",&a[1]);  //Address of second element
    printf("%p \n",&a[2]);  //Address of third element
    printf("%p \n",&a[3]);  //Address of fourth element
    printf("%p \n",p1);     //Address of first element
    printf("%d \n",*p1);    //Value at that address
    printf("%d \n",*(p1+1));  //Value at that address
    printf("%d \n",*(p1+2));  //Value at that address
    printf("%d \n",*(p1+3));  //Value at that address
    return 0;
