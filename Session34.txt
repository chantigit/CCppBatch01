Files in Cpp:
=============

->iostreams.h is a headerfie

->stream is a flow data 

->iostreams is used to perform read & write operations with console screen
	To write data into console screen cout we used 
	To read data from console screen cin we used 
	

fstream.h headerfie provides following 2 objects to perform read & write operations with the file.


->ofstream is a object used to perform write operation with file
->ifstream is a object used to perform read operation on the file

In C Language	:		FILE   *fp;
						fp=fopen("data1.txt","w/r/a");
						fp.fclose();

In Cpp Language	:		To perform write
						ofstream 	ob;
						ob.open("data1.txt");
						
In Cpp Language	:		To perform read
						ifstream 	ob;
						ob.open("data1.txt");

Program to wite & read data in file:
====================================
#include <fstream.h>
#include <iostream.h>
 
int main () 
{
   char data[100];

   // open a file in write mode.
   ofstream outfile;
   outfile.open("afile.txt");

   cout << "Writing data to the file" << endl;
   cout << "Enter your name: "; 
   cin.getline(data, 100);

   // write inputted data into the file.
   outfile << data << endl;

   cout << "Enter your age: "; 
   cin >> data;
   cin.ignore();
   
   // again write inputted data into the file.
   outfile << data << endl;

   // close the opened file.
   outfile.close();

   // open a file in read mode.
   ifstream infile; 
   infile.open("afile.txt"); 
 
   cout << "Reading from the file" << endl; 
   infile >> data; 

   // write the data at the screen.
   cout << data << endl;
   
   // again read the data from the file and display it.
   infile >> data; 
   cout << data << endl; 

   // close the opened file.
   infile.close();

   return 0;
}


File drawbacks:
================
1.Metadata cannot be specified
2.Duplication is allowed
3.Empty/Null values are valued
4.No recovery mechanism
5.No security mechanism (no authentication)
6.Huge amount of data cannot be maintained
7.Data retrival & modification is very complex
8.Cannot make relationship between 2 files


To resolve these drawbacks we used Databases.
Note:
	File store data in 		textual format.
	Database store data in 	table format.

Cell	: One intersection of row & column is called as a cell.
Table 	: Collection interrelated rows & columns is called as Table.
