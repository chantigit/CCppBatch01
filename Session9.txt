1.Register		: A register is a storage area where we can store literals(values)

2.Literal		: A literal is value which is stored into the register.

3.Identifier	: An identifier is name which is given to register(variable/constant)

4.Varibale		: A variable is a register which literal can be varies

5.Constant		: A constant is a register which literal cannot be varies

	function name		use of function
	=============		===============
	1.main() 			Code execution starts from this function
	2.printf()			Used to Print / Write data into console screen
	3.clrscr()			Erase the previous output from the console screen
	4.getch()			runs the code after compilation
	

1.Literal types:
++++++++++++++++
	1.Integer  literals				=	25,69,78,..
	2.Float literals				=	9.8,3.14,5.8,..
	3.Character literals			=	'A','a','@',...
	4.String literals				=	"Ajay","Apple",..

2.Identifier rules:
+++++++++++++++++++
An identifier can be formed by using following character set.
	1.Alphabets			:	A,...Z,  a,..z
	2.Digits			:	0,..9
	3.Special symbol	:	_

	DataTypes	Identifiers
	=========	==============
	int  		num1;
	int			age;
	float		height;
	int     	sub1,sub2,sub3,sub4;
	int     	cvv_number;
	int			atm_pin;
	
	int 		1num;					//invalid=>An identifier should not starts with a digit
	int 		sub1 sub2 sub3 sub4;	//invalid=>Multiple identifiers must be separated by comma not by space
	int			cvv#number;				//invalid=>An identifier should allow only _ (underscore)

3.Varibale	:
	syntax:
			datatype  	variablename;
	example:
			float		radius;
			float		height;
			int 		age;
		
4.Constant 	:
	syntax:
			const	datatype  	variablename=value;
	example:
			const   float 		pi		=3.14;
			const	float		gravity	=9.8;
			const   float		cgst	=9;
			
5.Keywords :
	It is reserved word which meaning already defined by compiler(turboc++).
	C language having 32 keywords
	
Ex1: "const" 	is a keyword, reserved for declare constants
Ex2: "int" 		is a keyword, reserved for  declare integers
Ex3: "float" 	is a keyword, reserved for declare float
Ex4: "if" 		is a keyword, reserved for test the condition
Ex5: "char" 	is a keyword, reserved for declare characters

6.DataTypes:
============
Def:
	DataTypes are used to decide "what type of value has to be stored inside the register".
Ex1:
	int		a;	//Here a is declared with "int" type,so that it can hold only integer.
		a=10;	//valid
		a=3.6;	//invalid
		
	float	b;	//Here b is declared with "float" type,so that it can hold only float+int.
		b=3.6;	//valid
		b=6;	//valid
		b='A';	//invalid
		
	char   c;	//Here c is declared with "char" type,so that it can hold only characters.
		c='A';	//valid
		c=9.8888;//invalid
