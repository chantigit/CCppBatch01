Exceptions in Cpp:
=================
Error Vs Exception:
------------------
Error:	
		Error is a bug which is generated at compile time(ctrl+f9) due to improper syntax
		If error exist in code, then code cannot compiled
	Ex:
		; missing
		) missing
		vod keyword is not properly spelled
		} missing
		] missing

Exception:
		Exception is a bug which is generated at run time(alt+f5) due to improper logic
		If exception exist in code, then code gets compiled but show error msg in console
	Ex:
		dividing a number by zero


Q1.Can programmer handle error without touching source code ?
Ans: No
Q2.Can programmer handle exception without touching source code ?
Ans: Yes, if program already used following 3 keywords

		1.try
		2.catch
		3.throw

	"try" block used to prepare code which monitoring exceptions.
	If their exist exception in try block through "throw" keyword we have to send that exception to "catch" block.
	If their is no exceptions the normal flow of code is executed.
	
syntax of try,catch & throw keywords:

	try
	{
		throw "Exception Msg";
	}
	catch(Exception Variable e)
	{
		//handle the exception
	}

Example1:

#include <iostream>
int main() 
{
    int a,b,c;
	a=100;
	b=0;
	try	
	{
		if(b==0)
		{
			throw "You cannot divide a number by zero";
		}
		else
		{
			c=a/b;
			std::cout<<c;
		}
	}
	catch(const char *v)
	{
		std::cout<<v;
	}
    return 0;
}

Example2:

#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int age;
	age=15;
    try
    {
            if(age>100)
	            throw "Age must be lesser than 100";
        	else if(age>18)
		        std::cout<<"Valid age for voting";
	        else
	            std::cout<<"Age must be greater than 18";
    }
    catch(const char *v)
    {
        std::cout<<v;
    }
    return 0;
}
